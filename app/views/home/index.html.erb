      Even as our chapter continues to grow, there remains a place for everyone in H.E.A.T. at Texas
      A&M University! H.E.A.T. is a dedicated group focused on creating positive change through
      volunteering and peer education. Members engage in meaningful projects, build strong
      friendships, connect with the Aggie community, and make a real difference in others' lives—all
      while having fun! Some of our favorite projects include building ramps for those in need, working
      at food banks, cleaning up local and beach litter, and volunteering with various animal rescues
      and sanctuaries.

    <p>
      The Human Environmental Animal Team (H.E.A.T.) was first established in the early 2000s at
      Texas State University by Ian Smith (a really cool guy!). In the spring of 2013, Jacob Alpuerto
      founded the Texas A&M chapter. Since then, H.E.A.T. chapters have sprung up in high schools
      and universities across Texas.
