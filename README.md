### How to Contribute

1. Open another Ubuntu terminal at csce431/cold501/ (outside of docker instance)
	- this is where you commit things

2. We want to commit to a feature branch and follow TDD
	- check branch
		- ```console
			git branch
		  ```
	- switch branch
		- ```console
			git switch <branch>
		  ```
	- create an upstream reference to a new feature branch
		- ```console
			git checkout -b <feature_branch>
		  ```
	- only commit to a feature branch
	- make tests for your feature first in the spec/ directory
		- happy unit tests
		- sad unit tests
		- integration tests
	- once you're done working for the moment or want to commit your history
		- ```console
			git add .
		  ```
		- ```console
			git commit -m "<explain what you did>"
		  ```
		- ```console
			git push origin <feature_branch>
		  ```

3. Merge your changes and verify tests pass
	- create a pull request from <feature_branch> to dev on GitHub GUI
	- create a pull request from dev to test
		- ensure all tests pass
	- create a pull request from test to main
		- ensure the tests pass and the test branch is working locally
